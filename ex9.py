# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFab\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"
print("Here are the days:"), days
print("Here are the months:"), months

print("""
	There's something going on here.
	With the three double-quotes.
	We'll be able to type as much as we like.
	Even 4 lines if we want, 5, or 6.
	""") 
'''
第一次練習的結果為：
('Here are the days:', 'Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun')
('Here are the months:', 'Jan\nFab\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug')

	There's something going on here.
	With the three double-quotes.
	We'll be able to type as much as we like.
	Even 4 lines if we want, 5, or 6.
上面多出了()
決定再進行一次練習，將Print原先的()進行縮小，在,前完成（）閉合。看看結果為何？
顯示結果為下：
Here are the days: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
Here are the months: Jan

	There's something going on here.
